                    This app uses cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) to
                    analyze images captured by your device's camera. By
                    proceeding, you agree to the following terms:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Data Transmission:</b> Images taken by the app will be
                    securely sent to an external AI service provider for
                    analysis. These images are temporarily stored and processed
                    in the cloud to generate insights based on the specified
                    prompt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. Data Privacy:</b> We take your privacy seriously.
                    Images sent for analysis are not stored locally after
                    processing, and our app does not retain any user data beyond
                    what is needed for functionality. However, please be aware
                    that images may be subject to the AI service provider's
                    privacy policies. For details on data handling by the AI
                    provider, please review their privacy policy.

                    <b>3. Notification and Monitoring:</b> The app allows for
                    notifications to be sent via email and SMS/WhatsApp based on
                    specific image analysis results. By enabling these features,
                    you acknowledge and consent to notifications that may
                    contain personal or sensitive data.

                    <b>4. Limitations and Liability:</b> While we strive to
