                This app uses cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) to

                <b>1. Data Transmission:</b> Images taken by the app will be
                securely sent to an external AI service provider for analysis.
                These images are temporarily stored and processed in the cloud
                to generate insights based on the specified prompt.

                <b>2. Data Privacy:</b> We take your privacy seriously. Images
                sent for analysis are not stored locally after processing, and
                our app does not retain any user data beyond what is needed for
                functionality. However, please be aware that images may be
                subject to the AI service provider's privacy policies. For
                details on data handling by the AI provider, please review their
                privacy policy.

                <b>3. Notification and Monitoring:</b> The app allows for
                notifications to be sent via email and SMS/WhatsApp based on
                specific image analysis results. By enabling these features, you
                acknowledge and consent to notifications that may contain
                personal or sensitive data.
